**riojaPlot** is optimised for plotting (bio)stratigraphic data.  Follow these simple rules to get started:

1. Put your data in an Excel spreadsheet organised with samples / levels in rows and variables / taxa in columns.
2. Include a single row of column headings that will be used a variable names.
3. Column headings that start with "Depth" or "Age" will be used as y-axis variables ("Depth_in_m"" or "AgeBP"" are fine, "Years BP" or "core depth" are not). All other columns will be used as x-axis variables.
4. Your data must be all numeric and have no missing values. If riojaPlot reports missing values cut and paste your data into a blank spreadsheet and try again.
5. Data is plotted 'as is'. If you want to plot percentage abundance of microfossil counts you must supply percentage data (not counts or proportions).  
6. Enjoy!
